<p>The Rottweiler is a breed of domestic dog, regarded as medium-to-large or large.
   The dogs were known in German as Rottweiler Metzgerhund, meaning Rottweil butchers' dogs,
    because their main use was to herd livestock[3] and pull carts laden with butchered meat to market.
     This continued until the mid-19th century when railways replaced droving.
      Although still used to herd stock in many parts of the world, Rottweilers are now also used as search and rescue dogs
      , guard dogs, and police dogs.</p>
